--- @section Audio Messages
--- These functions control audio messages, 2D sounds typically used for radio messages, voiceovers, and narration.
--- Audio messages use the Voice Volume setting from the Audio Options menu.

--- Repeat the last audio message.
function RepeatAudioMessage() end

--- Plays the given audio file, which must be an uncompressed RIFF WAVE (.WAV) file.
--- Returns an audio message handle.

--- @section Sound Effects
--- These functions control sound effects, either positional 3D sounds attached to objects or global 2D sounds.
--- Sound effects use the Effects Volume setting from the Audio Options menu.

--- Plays the given audio file, which must be an uncompressed RIFF WAVE (.WAV) file.
--- Specifying an object handle creates a positional 3D sound that follows the object as it moves and stops automatically when the object goes away. Otherwise, the sound plays as a global 2D sound.
--- Priority ranges from 0 to 100, with higher priorities taking precedence over lower priorities when there are not enough channels. The default priority is 50 if not specified.
--- Looping sounds will play forever until explicitly stopped with StopSound or the object to which it is attached goes away. Non-looping sounds will play once and stop. The default is non-looping if not specified.
--- Volume ranges from 0 to 100, with 0 being silent and 100 being maximum volume. The default volume is 100 if not specified.
--- Rate overrides the playback rate of the sound file, so a value of 22050 would cause a sound file recorded at 11025 Hz to play back twice as fast. The rate defaults to the file's native rate if not specified.
--- @param filename string
--- @param h Handle?
--- @param priority integer?
--- @param loop boolean?
--- @param volume integer?
--- @param rate integer?
function StartSound(filename, h, priority, loop, volume, rate) end

--- Stops the sound using the given filename and associated with the given object. Use a handle of none or nil to stop a global 2D sound.
--- @param filename string
--- @param h Handle?
function StopSound(filename, h) end

--- @section Game Object
--- These functions create, manipulate, and query game objects (vehicles, buildings, people, powerups, and scrap) and return or take as a parameter a game object handle.
--- Object handles are always safe to use, even if the game object itself is missing or destroyed.

--- Returns the handle of the game object with the given label. Returns nil if none exists.
--- @param label string
--- @return Handle?
--- @deprecated See `_gameobject` module.

--- @param odfname string
--- @param teamnum TeamNum
--- @param location Vector|Matrix|Handle|string Position vector, transform matrix, Object, or path name.
--- @param point integer? If the location is a path this is the path point index, defaults to 0.
--- @return Handle?
--- @deprecated See `_gameobject` module.
function BuildObject(odfname, teamnum, location, point)
    error("This function is provided by the engine.");
end

--- Removes the game object with the given handle.
---
--- {(!!)(!!) Unsafe to use on a handle passed in by CreateObject(h), doing so will crash the game. If you need this functionality,
--- you should defer the deletion until the next Update(dt).}
---
--- {(!)Multiplayer(!) Very dangerous. There are innumerable cases which can cause objects to be improperly deleted and/or
--- spawn explosion chunks which may only be visible to certain players. In order to safely delete a distributed object,
--- ALL players must call RemoveObject(h) on the target object simultaneously. Additionally, attempting to delete the starting
--- recycler in a strategy or MPI game will crash the game.}
