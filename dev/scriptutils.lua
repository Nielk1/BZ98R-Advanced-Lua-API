-- Audio Messages
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- @section
-- These functions control audio messages, 2D sounds typically used for radio messages, voiceovers, and narration.
-- Audio messages use the Voice Volume setting from the Audio Options menu.

--- Repeat the last audio message.
--- @function RepeatAudioMessage
function RepeatAudioMessage() end

--- Plays the given audio file, which must be an uncompressed RIFF WAVE (.WAV) file.
--- Returns an audio message handle.
--- @param filename string
--- @return AudioMessage
--- @function AudioMessage
function AudioMessage(filename) error("This function is provided by the engine."); end

--- Returns true if the audio message has stopped. Returns false otherwise.
--- @param msg AudioMessage
--- @return boolean
--- @function IsAudioMessageDone
function IsAudioMessageDone(msg) error("This function is provided by the engine."); end

--- Stops the given audio message.
--- @param msg AudioMessage
--- @function StopAudioMessage
function StopAudioMessage(msg) end

--- Returns true if <em>any</em> audio message is playing. Returns false otherwise.

function IsAudioMessagePlaying() error("This function is provided by the engine."); end

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Sound Effects
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- @section
-- These functions control sound effects, either positional 3D sounds attached to objects or global 2D sounds.
-- Sound effects use the Effects Volume setting from the Audio Options menu.

--- Plays the given audio file, which must be an uncompressed RIFF WAVE (.WAV) file.
--- Specifying an object handle creates a positional 3D sound that follows the object as it moves and stops automatically when the object goes away. Otherwise, the sound plays as a global 2D sound.
--- Priority ranges from 0 to 100, with higher priorities taking precedence over lower priorities when there are not enough channels. The default priority is 50 if not specified.
--- Looping sounds will play forever until explicitly stopped with StopSound or the object to which it is attached goes away. Non-looping sounds will play once and stop. The default is non-looping if not specified.
--- Volume ranges from 0 to 100, with 0 being silent and 100 being maximum volume. The default volume is 100 if not specified.
--- Rate overrides the playback rate of the sound file, so a value of 22050 would cause a sound file recorded at 11025 Hz to play back twice as fast. The rate defaults to the file's native rate if not specified.
--- @param filename string
--- @param h? Handle
--- @param priority? integer
--- @param loop? boolean
--- @param volume? integer
--- @param rate? integer
--- @function StartSound
function StartSound(filename, h, priority, loop, volume, rate) end

--- Stops the sound using the given filename and associated with the given object. Use a handle of none or nil to stop a global 2D sound.
--- @param filename string
--- @param h? Handle
--- @function StopSound
function StopSound(filename, h) end

--- @function GetClassId
--- @deprecated Use `_gameobject.GetClassId` instead.
